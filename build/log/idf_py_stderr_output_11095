CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/gleb/ESP32_projects/BMP280_CPP/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/gleb/ESP32_projects/hello_world/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/gleb/ESP32_projects/BMP280_CPP/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/gleb/ESP32_projects/hello_world/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
